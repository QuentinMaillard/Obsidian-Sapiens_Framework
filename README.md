# S.A.P.I.E.N.S
## The global PKM Framework
A philosophy of everyday life applied to Obsidian, to support curiosity, thinking, projects, relationships and introspection.

⚠️ This is an Alpha version that I hope will ignite discussions, provoke introspection, and give people a head start in the wondrous world of PKM/Obsidian.💫

# 🤔 What is this?
The **SAPIENS** framework a simple ***model*** of a **normal human every-day life** — especially occidental one, since mine looks like that—, a **structure for *Personal Life Management*** (*The tryptic :  Information + Experience + Action*)

The model is a virtualisation of the main areas of mundane life that aims to help:
- **Interpret events and reflect on ourselves** thanks to the shape of the framework
- **Diffract all the inputs thrown at us** into the various areas of the framework structure
- **Produce new ideas or links and process thoughts and emotions**
- **Create outputs and maintain a knowledge around what counts for us**

## To sum it up
"**S.A.P.I.E.N.S**" stands for:
- Self-care
- Activities
- Provisioning
- Involvement
- Emergence
- Nexus
- Standards

➡️ This underlying structure and the whole approach's intent is what I call the **Foundation**

➡️ Each letter of SAPIENS represents a **Space** in the **Foundation**, each **Space** will have **Dimensions** and **Embodiments**

➡️ Everything is **Indexed** with an agnostic **numbering** system.

*👉 To understand more about what all that mean, **how the framework works** and all the **philosophy** behind it, read the section [👩‍💻 Usage (standard)](#-usage-standard)*

*👉 To understand more about **my intention and its aims**, read the section [🌱 Intention](#-intention) below.*

# 🫵 Is it for you?
- Are you starting in PKM?
- Do you want to discover new ways of organizing?
- Do you look for an Obsidian boiler plate?
- Zettelkasten does not feel enough?
- You like the idea of*PARA* by Tiago Forte but strangely you can't wrap your mind around it?
- *ACCESS* by Nick Milo is efficient, but you wonder about similar, though different, systems?

Then there is a chance you might like SAPIENS! 🥰

# 🌱 Intention
My intention with this construct, is to help people **self-reflect** on what their life is made of, what are the different spaces and dimensions they can **invest themselves into**.

It can be impressive at first, but in the use I wanted it to be very simple, with an initial top-down structure that gives **a lot of liberty inside it**, that I then invite you to customise and make yours, in your own way.

*👉 I don't want it to be an overwhelming structure, but a fluid one. If it feels like so, do not hesitate to give me some feedbacks!*

I want the SAPIENS Framework to be a global file/information taxonomy and philosophy to spark and support your curiosity, your thinking, your projects and responsibilities, and your introspections. 

👉 **It looks in a lot of ways to ACCESS from Nick Milo and PARA from Tiago.**
During my PKM journey I've built a personal system to meet my need, and it converged toward what I will later discover as the ACCESS framework.

Obviously, with so much quality in these frameworks (and people), I was deeply inspired, but I tried to go beyond it with some help from system theory, Wilber's approach and my own views on life (more about that in the [👩‍💻 Usage (standard)](#-usage-standard) section).

There is room for improvement, check roadmap an the end 👇

# 🧑‍🔧  Installation
0. (to get updates, *⭐* *Star* this repository)
1. Code -> Download ZIP -> Unzip
2. Open Obsidian
3. "Open Folder as Vault"
4. Chose the unzipped folder "SAPIENS-Framework"
5. Read the explanation below 
6. Start exploring from the • Home • page

*👉 If you are familiar with github, instead of the first step you can fork this repository and git clone the fork to have a versioned vault. This is what I do, it is extremely useful for backups.*

# 👩‍💻 Usage (standard)
👉 *This repository is like the LYT-Kit from Nick Milo, it is a proposition, based on personal experience and reflection, so you can nurture your own reflection about your current system, or just use it as a boiler-plate/template for your new system.* 

👉 *Play around, explore, and don't hesitate a second to send me DM to talk about it or anything else, I'll be glad to chit-chat (twitter link at the bottom)*

There are three main particularities to this system : the **Foundation** —which is the structure of the framework and its underlying particularities—, the **SAPIENS** structure, and the **Indexing** system — supported by a dewey-like numbering.

## The Foundation 
In the **Foundation**, a folder or note (except for extras) can be of three types:
- **Space**
- **Dimension** (of a space) and sub-dimension
- **Embodiment** (of a space or dimension)

➡️ A **Space** in an empty area, a possibility, it's made to be yours and filled by you. 

The 7 current spaces reflect (*see below for more*) the big areas of mundane life, from **information to action**, with consideration to structuring stuff like relationships (involvement), habits (standards), and self-care.

Each **Space** has a particular aim, and a unique functioning!

You won't spend as much time is the 100s than in the 700s, your notes inside them won't have the same periodicity (eg. daily notes in jour journal or a note about somebody), or even the same lifespan (eg. projects notes vs knowledge notes).

➡️ A **Dimension** is a way of moving in a **Space**. 

It's completely up to you to know what dimensions there will be in the different spaces; they will be sub folders to organize your notes/diffract information according to your needs. 

All **Dimensions** of a **Space** follow a same intention and aim (support understanding of the world, help you introspect, etc) but will have its own set of rules concerning periodicity, nature, subjects, lifespan, etc.

It gives granularity to the big areas of your life, a granularity you completely chose. The important is always to be **intentional** and **aware** of the guiding rules of you actions.

In this repository you will find some examples of dimensions to inspire you and get you started.

➡️ An **Embodiment** is the manifestation of a construct (**Spaces** or **Dimensions**) in our life, a place of active thinking and work.

An Embodiment can be a note or a folder (collection of notes) at any level (Space, Dimension, Sub-Dimension).

An embodiment is a fluid object, made to incarnate a particular intention and objective, use it at will! 
You can even have Dimensions or Sub-Dimensions as embodiments, like what I did with projects in Activities. At the same time a "Sub-Dimension" and an embodiment of the dimension. 

These are guidelines and intents, now use them and break them as you wish!

## SAPIENS structure
The current **Spaces** are inspired from:
- Nick Milo's ACCESS and Tiago Forte's PARA
- Wilber's quadrants
- System Theory (*input -> process -> output*)
- My view on Personal Life Management (PLM = Information + Experience + Action)

Each **Space** descend from a particularity of personal life.

Their order follow a logical evolution. Let's see why.

In Wilber's matrix in his integral approach, there are 4 quadrants : 
- **Individual Subjective** : individual experiences of reality, emotions, intentions and mindsets, representations
- **Individual Objective** : individual skills and actions, personal structures
- **Collective Objective** : collective events and behaviours, social organisation
- **Collective Subjective** : collective emotions and values, culture and group moral

This is our the starting point.

*👉 You can learn more about each **Space** and **Dimension** in the examples of index notes I've created in the vault, where their nature of the content and aims are described.*

## The Indexing
The method of **Indexing** simply involves creating one note per folder of space/dimension/embodiment, whose name is the same as the folder. Moreover, each **index** has its own **unique number** according to place it occupies in the **Foundation** (*see below*).

There are some advantages to that:
- Having a nice obsidian graph
- Navigation by links
- Easy referencing of a place in your **Foundation** (from inside or outside your vault)
- Facilitated file search and navigation from a place to another
- Easy search in Archives

It can feel a bit annoying to create an index for each place, but with templates it is made very easy, and the more you use the framework, the less you have to do it, as all **Spaces** and **Dimensions** are already in place —hopefully, these will move and change along your life, but you see what I mean.

The indexing and ordering of the **Foundation** is helped by the following numbering system:
- **000** Space
- **010.** Dimension
- **011:** Sub-Dimension
	- Just another degree of precision for a dimension, can be useful to multiply our taxonomy and gain granularity
- **XXX** • Embodiment
- • folder/file •
	- Just notes and folders you want to stand out for whatever reason, without being its own place or embodiment
	- I personally use it for miscellaneous files and support notes
- *No numbers*
	- Just notes and folders of a place

The numbering is inspired by:
- The Dewey system
- Johnny Decimal

The **Indexing** is not mandatory for **SAPIENS/The Foundation** to work, nor is the numbering system to the **Indexing**, but they help making indexes, retrieving data, and referencing vault's place in other systems (calendars app, other note taking apps, tasks lists, post-its, emails, etc).

What I like about it, is that it is an incentive to **avoid too much folder nesting**.
It allows it, but your structure will look better and work nicer if you don't go beyond folder in a sub-dimension, it's ***guidelines by design***.
