# S.A.P.I.E.N.S
## A global PKM Framework
An approach to daily-life intended for Obsidian.

‚ö†Ô∏è This is an Alpha version that I hope will ignite discussions, provoke introspection, and give people a head start in the wondrous world of PKM/Obsidian.üí´

# ü§î What is this?
The **SAPIENS** framework a simple ***model*** of a **normal human every-day life** ‚Äî especially occidental one, since mine looks like that‚Äî, a **structure for *Personal Life Management*** (*The tryptic :  Information + Experience + Action*)

The model is a virtualisation of the main areas of mundane life that aims to help:
- **Interpret events and reflect on ourselves** thanks to the shape of the framework
- **Diffract all the inputs thrown at us** into the various areas of the framework structure
- **Produce new ideas or links and process thoughts and emotions**
- **Create outputs and maintain a knowledge around what counts for us**

"**S.A.P.I.E.N.S**" stands for:
- Self-care
- Activities
- Provisioning
- Involvement
- Emergence
- Nexus
- Standards
*üëâ To understand more about what each means, **how it works** and the **philosophy** behind it, read the section [üë©‚Äçüíª Usage (standard)](#-usage-standard)*

*üëâ To understand more about **my intention and its aims**, read the section [üå± Intention](#-intention) below.*

# ü´µ Is it for you?
- Are you starting in PKM?
- Do you want to discover new ways of organizing?
- Do you look for an Obsidian boiler plate?
- Zettelkasten does not feel enough?
- You like the idea of*PARA* by Tiago Forte but strangely you can't wrap your mind around it?
- *ACCESS* by Nick Milo is efficient, but you wonder about similar, though different, systems?

Then there is a chance you might like SAPIENS! ü•∞

# üå± Intention
My intention with this construct, is to help people **self-reflect** on what their life is made of, what are the different spaces and dimensions they can **invest themselves into**.

It can be impressive at first, but in the use I wanted it to be very simple, with an initial top-down structure that gives **a lot of liberty inside it**, that I then invite you to customise and make yours, in your own way.

*üëâ I don't want it to be an overwhelming structure, but a fluid one. If it feels like so, do not hesitate to give me some feedbacks!*

I want the SAPIENS Framework to be a global file/information taxonomy and philosophy to spark and support your curiosity, your thinking, your projects and responsibilities, and your introspections. 
It looks a lot like ACCESS from Nick Milo. On my side I built a personal system to meet my need, and it converged toward what I will later discover as the ACCESS framework. I then nurtured my reflection with it, and tried to go beyond it, helped with system theory (more about that in the [üë©‚Äçüíª Usage (standard)](#-usage-standard) section)

There is room for improvement, check roadmap an the end üëá

# üßë‚Äçüîß  Installation
0. (to get updates, *‚≠ê* *Star* this repository)
1. Code -> Download ZIP -> Unzip
2. Open Obsidian
3. "Open Folder as Vault"
4. Chose the unzipped folder "SAPIENS-Framework"
5. Read the explanation below 
6. Start exploring from the ‚Ä¢ Home ‚Ä¢ page

*üëâ If you are familiar with github, instead of the first step you can fork this repository and git clone the fork to have a versioned vault. This is what I do, it is extremely useful for backups.*

# üë©‚Äçüíª Usage (standard)
üëâ *This vault is like the LYT-Kit from Nick Milo, it is a proposition, based on personal experience and reflection, so you can nurture your own reflection about your current system, or just use it as a boiler-plate/template for your new system.* 

üëâ *Play around, explore, and don't hesitate a second to send me DM to talk about it or anything else, I'll be glad to chit-chat (twitter link at the bottom)*

There are two main particularities to this system : the **Foundation** ‚Äîwhich is the structure of the framework and its underlying particularities‚Äî and the **Indexing** system ‚Äî supported by a dewey-like numbering, and the existing.

In the **Foundation**, a folder or note (except for extras) can be of three types:
- **Space**
- **Dimension** (of a space) and sub-dimension
- **Embodiment** (of a space or dimension)

‚û°Ô∏è A **Space** in an empty area, a possibility, it's made to be yours and filled by you. 

The 7 current spaces reflect (*see below for more*) the big areas of mundane life, from **information to action**, with consideration to structuring stuff like relationships (involvement), habits (standards), and self-care.

Each **Space** has a particular aim, and a unique functioning!

You won't spend as much time is the 100s than in the 700s, your notes inside them won't have the same periodicity (eg. daily notes in jour journal or a note about somebody), or even the same lifespan (eg. projects notes vs knowledge notes).

‚û°Ô∏è A **Dimension** is a way of moving in a **Space**. 

It's completely up to you to know what dimensions there will be in the different spaces; they will be sub folders to organize your notes/diffract information according to your needs. 

All **Dimensions** of a **Space** follow a same intention and aim (support understanding of the world, help you introspect, etc) but will have its own set of rules concerning periodicity, nature, subjects, lifespan, etc.

It gives granularity to the big areas of your life, a granularity you completely chose. The important is always to be **intentional** and **aware** of the guiding rules of you actions.

In this repository you will find some examples of dimensions to inspire you and get you started.

‚û°Ô∏è An **Embodiment** is the manifestation of a construct (**Spaces** or **Dimensions**) in our life, a place of active thinking and work.

An Embodiment can be a note or a folder (collection of notes) at any level (Space, Dimension, Sub-Dimension). 

An embodiment is a fluid object, made to incarnate a particular intention and objective, use it at will! 
You can even have Dimensions or Sub-Dimensions as embodiments, like what I did with projects in Activities. At the same time a "Sub-Dimension" and an embodiment of the dimension. 

These are guidelines and intents, now use them and break them as you wish!

## The Spaces structure
The current spaces are inspired from:
- Nick Milo's ACCESS and Tiago Forte's PARA
- Wilber's quadrants
- System Theory (*input -> process -> output*)
- My view on Personal Life Management (PLM = Information + Experience + Action)

Each **Space** descend from a particularity of personal life.

Their order follow a logical evolution. Let's see why.

In Wilber's matrix in his integral approach, there are 4 quadrants : 
- Individual Subjective : individual experiences of reality, emotions, intentions and mindsets, representations
- Individual Objective : individual skills and actions, personal structures
- Collective Objective: collective events and behaviours, social organisation
- Collective Subjective: collective emotions and values, culture and group moral

This is our the starting point.

Here it goes:
- ‚Ä¢ Extras ‚Ä¢ 
	- ‚û°Ô∏è Excluded file (in settings)
	- Contains vault stuff like attachements and templates
	- Place for archived stuff we don't want to see in graph and file search
- 100 Self-care
	- ‚û°Ô∏è Space supporting and representing the first quadrant: Individual Subjective
	- It's a "**process**" step in the system theory
	- It can support: 
		- Self awareness
		- Experience of the world
		- Emotion processing
		- Intentions and north stars
		- Reminders about life
	- Dimensions can be:
		- Journal
		- Feedbacks
		- Moodtracker
- 200 Activities
	- ‚û°Ô∏è Space supporting and representing the second quadrant: Individual Objective
	- It's an "**output**" step in the system theory
	- It can support: 
		- Life roles and Responsibilities
		- Actions taken or Projects
		- Application of skills
		- Notes to directly support our actions
	- Dimensions can be:
		- Responsibilities and *hats*
		- Projects
- 300 Provisionning
	- ‚û°Ô∏è Space supporting and representing the third quadrant: Collective Objective
	- It's an "**input**" step in the system theory
	- It can support:
		- Your readings
		- Note Taking
		- Collecting quotes and the words of others
		- Collection of articles and books your read
		- Readwise automatic imports
		- Ressources
	- Dimensions can be:
		- Readwise
		- Books/Articles/Movies/Quotes
		- Knowledge taxonomy: Philosophy/Science/Spirituality
- 400 Involvement
	-  ‚û°Ô∏è Space supporting and representing the fourth quadrant: Collective Subjective
	- It's an "**input**" step in the system theory 
	- It can support:
		- Community Nurturing
		- Social memories collection
	- Dimensions can be:
		- 
- 500 Emergence
	- ‚û°Ô∏è Space supporting and representing a mix of the 4 previous quadrants
	- It's a wonderful **mix of input/process/outputs** steps in the system theory 
	- It can support:
		- Idea emergence
		- Information from the world (in our own words of course)
		- Information about people 
		- Concepts and tiny frameworks
		- Note Making over Note Taking
	- Dimensions can be:
		- 
- 600 Nexus
	- ‚û°Ô∏è Space supporting linking between every precedent space
	- It's a "**process**" step in the system theory 
	- It can support:
		- A place for Map of contents
		- Logging
		- Summaries to prepare for new concepts and frameworks to share
	- Dimensions can be:
- 700 Standards
	- ‚û°Ô∏è Space supporting the learning from actions (one of my favorites tbh)
	- It's a "**process**" very close to "**outputs**" in the system theory 
	- It is inspired from Lean Standards, it is your personal frameworks for life
		- A recurring "gesture" needs a standard to prevent errors
		- Clear self-made guidelines allow for better efficiency
		- Written guidelines on a matter can be shared to improve community as a whole
	- It can support:
		- Self-reflexion and introspection
		- Feedback Loops
		- Daily efficiency
		- Remembering how to do something for a future action
	- Dimensions can be:
		- The same as Activities
		- Nature of gesture supported: tech/social/art

*üëâ You can learn more about each **Space** and **Dimension** in their index notes, where their nature of the content and aims are described.*

## The Indexing
This numbers represent folders and file according to their nature. 
It helps making indexes, retrieving data, and referencing vault's elements in other systems (calendars app, other note taking apps, tasks lists, post-its, emails, etc).
It is inspired by:
- The Dewey system
- Johnny Decimal

Here it goes:
- **000** Space
- **010.** Dimension
- **011.** Sub-Dimension
	- Just another degree of precision for a dimension, can be useful to multiply our taxonomy and gain granularity
- **XXX** ‚Ä¢ Embodiment
- No numbers
	- Just the notes linked to an embodiment or in the ‚Ä¢ Extras ‚Ä¢ folder

# üõ£Ô∏è Roadmap
