# Scout Mindset

## Introduction

- We rationalize our flaws and mistakes.
- We cherry-pick evidence.
- Our judgment isn't limited by knowledge as much as it is limited by attitude.

## Part 1: The Scout Mindset

### Chapter 1: Two Types of Thinking

#### Can I Believe, Must I Believe

- The Dreyfus Affair: Once the wheel of accusation started turning, investigators had a new motivation: to prove that they were right, otherwise they would lose face or even their job.
- This is an example of "directionally motivated reasoning" (DMR) where our unconscious motives affect the conclusions we draw.
- The soldier's attitude towards new information is "Can I believe it?" if it's positive for them and "Must I believe it?" if it seems negative.
- Seeking excuses to reject information.

#### Reasoning as Defensive Combat

- Tricky thing with motivated reasoning (MR): it's easy to spot in other people but hard to see in ourselves. We always feel objective, fair-minded, and dispassionate.
- Accuracy motivated reasoning (AMR) asks, "Is this true?"
- DMR is like a soldier fighting for evidence, while AMR is like a scout trying to map.
- A scout wants to find a safe path, knows that the other side may be weak, but above all wants to know what is really there.
- Comparison between soldier mindset and scout mindset:

### Chapter 2: What the Soldier Protects

- The Chesterton fence applied to soldier mindset.
- No matter how good the scout mindset looks, the argument will be incomplete without understanding why there is a soldier mindset.
- We use the soldier mindset to adopt and defend beliefs that give us emotional benefits (comfort, self-esteem, morale).
- We use the scout mindset to see things clearly and make good judgment calls.
- We use motivated reasoning not because we don't know any better (we can learn self-critique, biases, etc.), but because we try to protect things that are vital to us.

### Chapter 3: Why Truth Matters More Than We Realize

- We make unconscious trade-offs.
- Example: Julia asking biased questions to students about enjoying a workshop. The desire to protect self-esteem competes with the desire to learn about problems to fix. Result: an unconscious trade-off between soldier and scout, between protection and truth.
- Epistemic rationality: holding beliefs that are well-justified.
- Rationally irrational: good at unconsciously choosing just enough epistemic irrationality to achieve social and emotional goals without impairing our judgment too much.
- We are far from rationally irrational. Several biases make us misjudge the costs and benefits of truth in our decision-making. These biases cause us to overvalue the soldier mindset.

#### Present Biases

- We care too much about short

-term consequences and too little about long-term ones. For example, saying "it wasn't my fault" provides instant reward with emotional relief (short term), but the cost is missing out on learning from the mistake (long term).

#### Underestimate Building Scout Habits

- The benefits of adopting a scout mindset are not just about making the map better; they are also in the habits and skills we reinforce. Our way of thinking indirectly impacts us through these reinforcements.

#### Underestimate Ripple Effects of Self-Deception

- When you tell a lie, it is hard to predict exactly what you have committed your future self to. Self-deception about one aspect can lead to a distorted map of reality with ripple effects.

#### Overestimate Social Costs

- We overestimate the importance of how we come across to other people. The social costs of looking weird or making a fool of ourselves feel more significant than they actually are.
- Result: bad trade-offs where we sacrifice potential happiness to avoid small social costs.
- Scout is not always the better choice, but these biases show that we have big biases in favor of the soldier mindset, even when the scout mindset is a better choice.

### An Accurate Map is More Useful Now

- The world is becoming one that rewards the ability to see clearly, especially in the long run. It is not a world in which one's happiness is solely dependent on the ability to accommodate whatever life/skill/group one is born into.
