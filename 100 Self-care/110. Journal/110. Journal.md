This dimension is a polarisation of [[100 Self-care|my self care]] and container of **daily-notes of experiences and reflections**.

It aims to help me in **gain awareness on my daily life and process my emotions**.

👉 This is just one way of having a journal in Obsidian, with days and weeks, but it's all about how you want to use it. It is currently paired with the *calendar* plugin and *periodic notes*. See the settings of the corresponding plugins to see what how it is implemented with this vault numbering methodology.
