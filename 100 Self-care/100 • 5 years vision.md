👉 This concept of 5 year vision is completely inspired from [Eliot Meunier](https://www.youtube.com/@eliottmeunierinenglish7769/videos).

The purpose of this vision is to make day-to-day and long term choices **intentionally**, to have an stated **horizon** in mind.
This horizon is not a log of what you should have achieved, but rather a wholesome **direction** you want to head toward.

# My ideal day
How does my ideal day looks like 5 years from now?

👉 You can have from one to three ideal days, depending on the time of the week. This concept is a tool for you, use it as you wish!

- At what time am I waking up?
- What do I eat?
- What do I do waking up? What do I do in the morning?
- Who do I see?
- What am I working on?
- What's my hobby? How much time am I spending on it? Is my hobby my job?
- Where am I?

# My social identity

👉 Rather than a pure aim of reputation, it's about what qualities you want to nurture to interact with other humans and in society. As we are social creatures, it's simply the qualities you want to live with. It can be an ego trap, but beware, the aim is simply to self-reflect on who you are today and what you think you could improve or keep.

- What do I want to be known for? 
- What do I want people think of me? 
- How do I want my friend to describe me?
- What am I recommend for?

# What's on my website?
The stuff I would like to have digged and worked on, that I am proud to share with the world.

- Do I have books I've read?
- Do I have music I made?
- Do I have coding projects I've crafted? The projects I'm working on right now?
- Do I have trips I've made?
- Do I have my notes?
- Do I have my writings?
- Do I have my favorite poetry?
- Do I have picture of the house I built?
