This space is a representation and container of **knowledge about people I care about and/or I want to collaborate with**.

It aims to help me **remembering stuff about people and shines a light on possible new (types of) relationships**.

👉 This space is central, as it corresponds to an important part of your environment as a Homo Sapiens : other Homo Sapiens. Our lives are made of relationships, and the knowledge we have on those help shaping the quality of those. This space aims to support this knowledge.
