---

There are two main particularities to this vault : the indexing system supported by a dewey-like numbering, and the existing *spaces* supporting the S.A.P.I.E.N.S. approach.

In this vault, a folder or note (except for extras) can be of three types:
- Space
- Dimension (of the space)
- Embodiment (of the dimension)

Spaces represent the big areas of personal life, from **information to action**, with consideration to structuring stuff like relationships (involvement), habits (standards), and self-care.

### The Spaces structure
The different spaces are inspired from:
- Nick Milo's ACCESS
- Tiago Forte's PARA
- Wilber's quadrants
- System Theory (input -> process -> output)
- My view on PLM (Personal Life Management)

Each space descend from a particularity of personal life, with a logical evolution.
On Wilber's matrix in his integral approach, the quadrants are : interior subjective, interior objective, exterior objective, exterior subjective. This is our the starting point.

üëâ You can learn more about each space and dimension in their respective index notes, where are described the nature of the content and its aim.

Here it goes:
- ‚Ä¢ Extras ‚Ä¢ 
	- ‚û°Ô∏è Excluded file (in settings)
	- Contains vault stuff like attachements and templates
	- Place for archived stuff we don't want to see in graph and file search
- 100 Self-care
	- ‚û°Ô∏è Space supporting and representing the first quadrant: interior subjective
	- Self awareness
	- Experience of the world
	- Emotion processing
	- Intentions and north stars
	- Reminders about life
- 200 Activities
	- ‚û°Ô∏è Space supporting and representing the second quadrant: interior objective
	- Life roles and Responsibilities
	- Actions taken or Projects
	- Application of skills
	- Notes to directly support our actions
- 300 Provisionning
	- ‚û°Ô∏è Space supporting and representing the third quadrant: 
- 400 Involvement
	-  ‚û°Ô∏è Space supporting and representing the fourth quadrant: exterior subjective
	- Community Nurturing
	- Memories collection
- 500 Emergence
	- ‚û°Ô∏è Space supporting and representing a mix of the 4 previous quadrants
	- Idea emergence
	- Information from the world (in our own words of course)
	- Information about people 
	- Concepts and tiny frameworks
	- Note Making over Note Taking
- 600 Standards
	- ‚û°Ô∏è Space supporting the learning from action 
	- Inspired from Lean Standards
	- A recurring "gesture" needs a standard to prevent errors and improve efficacity
	- A space to support self-reflexion and introspection
	- Feedback Loop enabling
- 700 Nexus
	- ‚û°Ô∏è Space supporting linking between every precedent space
	- A place for Map of contents
	- Logging
	- Summaries to prepare for new concepts and frameworks to share

### The numbering
This numbers represent folders and file according to their nature. 
It helps making indexes, retrieving data, and referencing vault's elements in other systems (calendars app, other note taking apps, tasks lists, post-its, emails, etc).
It is inspired by:
- The Dewey system
- Johnny Decimal

Here it goes:
- **000** Space
	- It is the categories of the framework, the only "imposed" structure of our vault (of course modify it at will, it is my proposition with SAPIENS)
- **010.** Dimension
	- It is the components of our lives that fill the space, the different dimensions in which we evolve in this space
- **011.** Sub-Dimension
	- Just another degree of precision for a dimension, can be useful to multiply our taxonomy
- **XXX** ‚Ä¢ Embodiment
	- It is the manifestation of a dimension in our life, a place of active thinking and work
	- An Embodiment can be at any level (space, dimension, sub-dimension)
	- An embodiment is a fluid object, made to incarnate an intention and a way of doing, use it at will!
	- Exemple of fluid embodiment: projects in activities. At the same time a "Sub-Dimension" and an embodiment of the dimension
- No numbers
	- Just notes linked to an embodiment or in the ‚Ä¢ Extras ‚Ä¢ folder
