This dimension is a polarisation of [[700 Nexus]] and container of **notes that are Maps of content.**

It aims to help me **colliding informations and notes to create new concepts after its bits emerged in the 500 space and other parts of the vault.**

It is inspired by MOCs from the LYT framework.
