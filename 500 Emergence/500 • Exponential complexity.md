# Note

[[500 • Complexity (dfn)|Complexity]] increases exponentially based on the [number of elements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metcalfe%27s_law) that interact in a [[500 • System (dfn)|system]].
For 4 elements that interact, there are `4 x 4 = 16` possible connections. For 8 elements, there are `64` connections, and so on.

Learning to manage complexity means learning to master the complications that grow exponentially.
In computer science, these complications materialize in the form of [[500 • Technical debt (dfn)|technical debt]].
