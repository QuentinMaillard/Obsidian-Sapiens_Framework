# Note

Feedback is the ability of a [[500 â€¢ System (dfn)|system]] to receive as input the result of a previous output.

Feedback allows adjusting the system's functioning to change its behavior (its future outputs).

This is materialized by the **direct observation** of the result in the environment, by **requesting** information from another system, and by implementing **control measures**.

> [!example] Examples of feedback
>  - Requesting feedback from users of our website
>  - Sending satisfaction surveys
>  - Analyzing personal behaviors
>  - Room temperature detector for a boiler

Feedback enables [[feedback loops]].
