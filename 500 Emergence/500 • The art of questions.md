# Note

A question is the linguistic representation of a **lack of information** for understanding a subject (intellectualization, the why?) or for accomplishing an action (realization, the how?).

In that sense, it is the humble beginning of learning or undertaking, and it is an art to dare to admit one's ignorance and be guided by it to better understand the world and act correctly.
