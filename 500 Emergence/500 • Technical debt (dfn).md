# Note

A concept present in **software development** indicating that the accumulation of errors and outdated choices in a software's code constitutes technical debt.

This debt needs to be "repaid" by spending money and time to regularly repair and improve the code. Due to the [[500 • Exponential complexity|exponential complexity]] of a [[500 • System (dfn)|system]], if it is neglected, the debt accumulates, and its cost increases exponentially, sometimes leading to project abandonment or loss of organizational power.

The earlier and more regularly we address the debt (by practicing [clean code](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/clean_code) and maintainable code), the less we will pay in the long run, as we will avoid exponential phases. A good developer not only delivers good features but also avoids increasing the debt and considers other programmers.
