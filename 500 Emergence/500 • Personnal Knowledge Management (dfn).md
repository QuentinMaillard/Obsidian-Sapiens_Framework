Personal Knowledge Management (PKM) is a practice aimed at gathering information about the world and oneself through monitoring, exploration, reading, discussion, introspection, experience, etc., and then organizing it to create personal value.

This practice allows regaining control over the constant flow of information in life and giving meaning to our surroundings. It involves organizing perceptions, analyzing, associating, creating, and sharing, leading to a higher level of consciousness and greater creativity.
