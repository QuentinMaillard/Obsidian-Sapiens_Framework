# Note

Procrastination is the tendency to postpone an action.
It is a coping mechanism (avoidance strategy) of the brain when faced with an action deemed negative.

It is influenced by four psychological principles:
1. *Emotional valence*: the emotional cost or pleasure associated with the action
2. *Perceived utility* of the action
3. *Delay* between performing the action and the reward
4. *Tolerance* of the individual to delay and negative emotions

Therefore, there are **four possible areas of improvement**, four potential levers to act upon in order to complete a task now rather than later.

‚û°Ô∏è It can also be a potential signal that what we are undertaking is not good for us.
