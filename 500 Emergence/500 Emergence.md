This space is a representation of **my understanding of reality.**

It aims to help me in **making notes, nurturing my creativity, create novel links between things.**

It is inspired by **the Zettelkasten and LinkingYourThinking methods**

👉 There is no children to this index note, as I consider zettel/atomic notes must be linked organically. In the graph view, seeing orphans *emergence* notes will help the thinking by reflecting on their possible proximity with other notes. I put some notes around system theory to give you some examples.

👉 In my own vault, I have two sub folders in 500 Emergence : nebulae and stars. I consider atomic notes should be numerous, friction-less with your thoughts and concept capturing so it can nurture the system. Though, at the same time I like to have a clear view on what is not processed yet, so a nebulae is a star wannabe and I go through them regularly.
