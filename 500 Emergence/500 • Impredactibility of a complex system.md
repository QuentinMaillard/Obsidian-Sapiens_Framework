# Note

According to the principle of [[500 â€¢ Complexity (dfn)|complexity]], the more elements a system has that interact with each other, the more difficult it is to understand.
The brain is limited in its capacity for analysis and cannot visualize all the intricacies of elements or all the possible states that a system can take.

> [!example] Examples of complex and unpredictable systems
> - Code consisting of thousands of lines
> - A company with hundreds of employees
> - The human brain
