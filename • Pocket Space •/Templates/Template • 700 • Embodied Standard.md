# What is concerned
The structure and functioning of my obsidian vault.

# What do I want
I don't want my to be just a place of work and knowledge, I want it to be a place of emotions, contemplation, humor and poetry. 
A pocket size where you can find a digest of my life, of my personality, which goes beyond work and responsibilities, but which taps into beauty and experience.

# What can I do
Create a structure that fits my needs and the big areas of my life, that gives me enough freedom to make it evolve and look like me, that is practical enough to make the whole process of working and exploring easy and pleasant.
