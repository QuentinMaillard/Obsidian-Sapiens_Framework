This space is a container of **indexing notes.**

It aims to help me **gathering, re-organize agnostically and colliding informations, notes and ressources thanks to links**.

It is inspired by **index notes in the Zettelkasten method and MOC from the LYT framework**.

👉 Exemple of indexing notes can be MOCs, Logs, summaries, etc.
