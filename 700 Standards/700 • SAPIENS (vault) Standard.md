# What is concerned
The structure and functioning of my obsidian vault.

# What do I want
I don't want my to be just a place of work and knowledge, I want it to be a place of emotions, contemplation, humor and poetry. 
A pocket size where you can find a digest of my life, of my personality, which goes beyond work and responsibilities, but which taps into beauty and experience.

# What can I do
Create a structure that fits my needs and the big areas of my life, that gives me enough freedom to make it evolve and look like me, that is practical enough to make the whole process of working and exploring easy and pleasant.

# What is done

## The Foundation's structure
In the **Foundation**, a folder or note (except for extras) can be of three types:
- **Space**
- **Dimension** (of a space) and sub-dimension
- **Embodiment** (of a space or dimension)

Each of this type is what I am going to call a "**Place**".

‚û°Ô∏è A **Space** in an empty area, a possibility, it's made to be yours and filled by you. 

The 7 current spaces reflect (*see below for more*) the big areas of the actions of our everyday life, from **acquisition to production**, with consideration to structuring actions like being *involved* in relationships, cultivating habits *standards*, and taking *care of ourselves*.

Each **Space** has a particular aim, and a unique functioning!

You won't spend as much time is the 100s than in the 700s, your notes inside them won't have the same periodicity (eg. daily notes in jour journal or a note about somebody), or even the same lifespan (eg. projects notes vs knowledge notes).

‚û°Ô∏è A **Dimension** is a way of moving in a **Space**. 

It's completely up to you to know what dimensions there will be in the different spaces; they will be sub folders to organize your notes/diffract information according to your needs. 

All **Dimensions** of a **Space** follow a same intention and aim (support understanding of the world, help you introspect, etc) but will have its own set of rules concerning periodicity, nature, subjects, lifespan, etc.

It gives granularity to the big areas of your life, a granularity you completely chose. The important is always to be **intentional** and **aware** of the guiding rules of you actions.

In this repository you will find some examples of dimensions to inspire you and get you started.

‚û°Ô∏è An **Embodiment** is the manifestation of a construct (**Spaces** or **Dimensions**) in our life, a place of active thinking and work.

An Embodiment can be a note or a folder (collection of notes) at any level (Space, Dimension, Sub-Dimension).

An embodiment is a fluid object, made to incarnate a particular intention and objective, use it at will! 
You can even have Dimensions or Sub-Dimensions as embodiments, like what I did with projects in Activities. At the same time a "Sub-Dimension" and an embodiment of the dimension. 

These are guidelines and intents, now use them and break them as you wish!

## SAPIENS taxonomy
The current **Spaces** are inspired from:
- Nick Milo's ACCESS and Tiago Forte's PARA
- Wilber's quadrants
- System Theory (*input -> process -> output*)
- My view on Personal Life Management (PLM = Information + Experience + Action)

Each **Space** descend from a particularity of personal life.

Their order follow a logical evolution. Let's see why.

In Wilber's matrix in his integral approach, there are 4 quadrants : 
- **Individual Subjective** : individual experiences of reality, emotions, intentions and mindsets, representations
- **Individual Objective** : individual skills and actions, personal structures
- **Collective Objective** : collective events and behaviours, social organisation
- **Collective Subjective** : collective emotions and values, culture and group moral

This is our the starting point.

*üëâ You can learn more about each **Space** and **Dimension** in the examples of index notes I've created in the vault, where their nature of the content and aims are described.*

## The Indexing
The method of **Indexing** simply involves creating one note per folder of a **Place** (Space/Dimension/Embodiment), whose name is the same as the folder. 
Moreover, each **Place's index** has its own **unique number** according to the location it has in the **Foundation** (*see below*).

There are some advantages to that:
- Having a **nice obsidian graph** ‚ù§Ô∏è
- Navigation between **Places** by links
- Easy **referencing** of a place in your **Foundation** (from inside or outside your vault)
- **Facilitated file search/moving** with the *Quick Switcher* : firstly typing the number will **filter the whole vault** on **no other thing than the **"Place"** wanted** (including Archives)

It can feel a bit annoying to create an index for each **Place**, but with templates it is made very easy, and the more you use the framework, the less you have to do it, as all **Spaces** and **Dimensions** are already in place ‚Äîhopefully, these will move and change along your life, but you see what I mean.

### The numbering
The numbering is inspired by:
- The Dewey system
- Johnny Decimal

The indexing and ordering of the **Foundation** is helped by the following numbering system:
- **000** Space
- **010 .** Dimension
- **011 :** Sub-Dimension
	- Just another degree of precision for a dimension, can be useful to multiply our taxonomy and gain granularity
- **XXX** ‚Ä¢ Embodiment
- ‚Ä¢ folder/file ‚Ä¢
	- Just notes and folders you want to stand out for whatever reason, without being its own place or embodiment
	- I personally use it for miscellaneous files and support notes
- *No numbers*
	- Just notes and folders of a place

What I like about it, is that it is an incentive to **avoid too much folder nesting** by limiting the numbers to three levels.
It allows nesting, but your structure will look better and work nicer if you don't go much deeper than a sub-dimension, it's ***guidelines by design***.

### Index notes
The index notes are a place of information and work like any other.
They should help you jump right into the **Place** your are entering.
They should inform you about what the **Place** is about ‚Äî the why ‚Äî and what it contains.

Index can be used to:
- link people to a project
- store meta data (deadlines, start date, themes and tags)
- store todo's
- remind yourself your intentions, the importance of the **Place** you created

The **Indexing** is not mandatory for **SAPIENS/The Foundation** to work, nor is the numbering system to the **Indexing**, but they help making indexes, retrieving data, and referencing vault's place in other systems (calendars app, other note taking apps, tasks lists, post-its, emails, etc).
